Especially, acquiring relevant knowledge [ranks] first, followed by raising labor abilities. Obviously, the chart reveals that college students have attached growing importance to [practical] experience and personal development, reflecting their pursuit of balanced ability and knowledge.

Several primary factors can explain this phenomenon.

Obviously, the chart reveals that [individual] exercise has become the dominant form of physical activity, showing that people are paying more attention to personal [fitness] and flexibility.

Meanwhile, the proportion of students starting their own business also rose slightly from 1.3% to 2.6%. Obviously, the chart reflects that more graduates are paying attention to self-improvement and [diversified] career paths, rather than entering the job market directly after graduation.

Several primary factors can explain this trend. First and foremost, the increasingly [competitive] job market drives more graduates to pursue higher degrees to enhance their [employability]. In addition, the government and universities have provided strong support for [innovation] and entrepreneurship, encouraging students to explore new opportunities.
