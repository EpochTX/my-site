Especially, acquiring relevant knowledge [ranks] first, followed by raising labor abilities. Obviously, the chart reveals that college students have attached growing importance to [practical] experience and personal development, reflecting their pursuit of balanced ability and knowledge.

Several primary factors can explain this phenomenon.

In addition, labor education helps students develop [teamwork] and problem-solving skills, which are essential in modern society.

In addition, as students advance through college, their academic pressure becomes more manageable, allowing them more [flexibility] to take part-time jobs.
